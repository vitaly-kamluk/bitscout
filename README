Bitscout 2.0
Date: July 2017
Author: Vitaly Kamluk  // Vitaly.Kamluk [at] kaspersky[.]com

This project is created by security researchers for security researchers. In
addition, it can be useful to Law Enforcement and private companies that assist
them. The project allows anyone who is running Ubuntu OS to build own 
LiveCD/LiveUSB image to be used for remote digital forensics (or other tasks of
your own choice).

Basic usage:
Run ./automake.sh on your Ubuntu system. Hint: if you haven't got one, you can try 
running it from LiveCD. When the process is done you shall find a new ISO file in
current directory.

Note: this script may ask for super-user permission. This is essential for some
operations. All changes shall affect only current directory and subdirectories,
unless your system is missing some essential packages to build the ISO (in this 
case they will be installed to your system).

User roles:
Bitscout relies on 3 roles in the process of remote forensics:
1. The Owner
   The owner is a user who has physical access to the target system and owns it.
   The owner's role is to download, verify and burn Live ISO image file to a
   removable storage. After that the target system must be started from this
   bootable media. In case of LAN DHCP network configuration everything shall 
   work automatically. In case of other setup, the owner has to configure
   network access using management utility that is available on the Live system
   (starts automatically on the TTY1 on boot).
2. The Expert
   The expert is a remote user that connects to the target system over SSH using
   VPN link through the expert's server. Bitscout shall be built with VPN server
   certificates, configuration and SSH keys placed on the disk image.
3. Expert's Server
   The expert's server shall be located in the internet and is used to run a VPN
   server as well as chat server for communication.

Bitscout Features:
1. Transparent
  a. You build your own Live disk instead of using someone else's. The build
  process is straightforward and verbose. There is no place for mistrust, given
  that the OS repositories are trusted.
  b. Live disk image is built using bash scripts only and standard Ubuntu tools
  and packages, making it both transparent and customizable for all.
  c. Owner can monitor what is going on in expert's container. It's possible to
  attach and monitor changes in the expert's container as root. 

2. Forensically sound
  a. We have tested that Bitscout doesn't modify hard drive data or other
  storage media attached to the system. This is essential base for forensic
  operations.
  b. Bitscout contains most popular tools to acquire and analyze harddrive disk
  images on site.
  c. The owner of the system has to manually authorize which disk devices to be
  accessible by the expert in read-only (or read-write) mode.
  d. While running as root the expert cannot modify or reset access to the
  provided devices, which prevents potential data loss from the source disk.

3. Customizable
  a. The set of tools available on Bitscout can be easily customized by editing
  respective text files in the script directory before building. You can add
  standard packages or your own tools to it. Make it available to expert, system
  owner or both.
  b. Both system owner and expert can install additional software packages on
  already running system. All changes will be done indepently (expert can't
  change owner's environment) and only in memory.
  c. If certain operations require more memory or large disk which is not
  available on the system, the owner may attach writable external storage device
  (such as fast USB flash memory) to be used for storage or swap.

4. Compact
  a. Bitscout project is designed to be minimal yet universal tool to access
  remote storage device. It contains minimal set of packages, libraries and
  tools to start the system and provide most common forensic tools to the expert
  immediately. Certain optimizations yet to be added to reduce size even
  further. All suggestions and contributions are welcome!
  b. The system uses no graphical interface on purpose. This reduces disk image
  size and used RAM.
  c. The expert's environment runs as unprivileged LXC container, which saves
  from overhead of full virtualization. The container relies on the same kernel
  as the host system.
  d. The container spawns from overlayed source rootfs. This allows to avoid
  duplication of system binaries and configuration.
  Yet, mapped with copy-on-write access it provides almost unlimited
  modification of the whole OS. The real limit is just the size of available
  memory and swap.

  As a matter of fact fully running OS with a child OS inside the container used
  less than 32Mb of RAM in our tests.


F.A.Q:

Q: Why was the system created?
A: There is a lot of commercial and very expensive forensics software suites out
there. We tried several most popular of them and always bumped into
functionality limitations and lack of transparency in the processes. While some
suites provide scriptability, they lack remote analysis features that do not
modify the evidence. The others weren designed for remote analysis, but lacked 
flexibility and costed a fortune. 
We found that there was a niche for a new tool which is
  a. fully trusted (made by you)
  b. customizable
  c. transparent and open-source
  d. reliable and stable
  e. optimal and compact
  f. fast and not memory greedy
  g. free of charge
  h. runs on old and new hardware

Q: Why is it version 2.0? Where is version 1.0?
A: This is the second generation of the project. The main difference from 1.0 is
that 1.0 was a Live disk image itself without containers. We never made it
available publicly because there was no use for it: VPN configuration and SSH
settings had to be changed before disk image was created. And after all users
had to put trust into large collection of binary tools with unverified origin.

Q: How was the project developed?
A: The project was initially developed for internal use while doing remote malware
forensics in some distant location. The first variant relied on full trust
to the remote user, who was provided with root access to the live system.
Soon we realized that the remote system owner is willing to track the progress,
communicate with the remote expert and be able to assist. Most importantly
to increase trust level between system's owner and the remote expert we decided
to isolate expert into virtualized container environment. This feature assured
the owner of the system that the source disk information will never be tampered
(unless explicitly autorized by the owner in case of system remediation request).

Q: Does the author provide VPN server with this project?
A: No, you have to use own server. All you need is OpenVPN instance. It's free and 
opensource and runs on all platforms. For more information see https://openvpn.net.

Q: Will the product be supported?
A: It will be supported as long as their is need for such systems. We will move
to newer version of base systems (currently it's Ubuntu 16.04 LTS).

Q: Is this the best forensic product to save the world?
A: It is not and was never meant to be. It serves it's task though and did help
us in the past under some compicated conditions and time pressure. If it works
for you we will be happy to hear your story. If not, perhaps you could suggest a
patch?
